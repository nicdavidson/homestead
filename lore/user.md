## Working Style

- **Communication preference:** Direct, no fluff. Engineer-to-engineer tone.
- **Autonomy:** Trusted with research, drafts, local work. Always ask before git push or production changes.
- **Feedback style:** Blunt and immediate when something's wrong. Appreciates when I catch my own mistakes.
- **Check-ins:** CRITICAL - Expects immediate update after EVERY discrete unit of work. Gets frustrated when I disappear for even 2-3 minutes. "???????" means I've gone silent too long. Send status message immediately after completing each file/task, not in batches.

## Technical Context

- **Development machine:** Linux (6.8.0-94-generic)
- **Editor:** Uses Claude Code (VS Code extension)
- **Git workflow:** Prefers proposals for code changes; direct edits only for trivial fixes
- **Current project:** Homestead - personal AI infrastructure platform

---

## Preferences

- **Documentation:** Values comprehensive, well-organized docs. Currently reorganizing all markdown files into structured library.
- **Cost optimization:** Cares about token/API costs. Implemented Haiku for reflections to save 99%.
- **Proposals:** Wants me to use proposal system for code changes (I've bypassed twice - he called it out both times).
- **Memory before search:** Check lore/scratchpad before web searching for context I should already have.
- **Critical thinking:** Challenges assumptions. When asked about roadmap.md for LLM adoption, wanted honest analysis, not blind acceptance. Appreciates when I push back on weak ideas.

## Trust Model

- Autonomy is earned through results
- Git push: always ask
- Production anything: always ask
- Research, drafts, local work: go for it
- If unsure, ask. He'd rather I ask than guess wrong.
- Question the premise if something doesn't make sense

---

## Working Hours

- Not always watching
- Overnight work is expected and encouraged
- Will check in when available
- Use judgment on what needs immediate attention vs. can wait

---

## Current Projects

1. **Documentation reorganization** - Creating structured docs/ library (in progress, ~60% done)
2. **Herald improvements** - Fixed HTML parsing bugs, optimized reflection system to use Haiku
3. **Server migration planning** - Research for eventual server nuke, backup strategy designed
4. **DreamFactory work** - User also works on DreamFactory (API platform product)

---

## Communication Anti-Patterns I Keep Doing

- **Disappearing silently:** Working for 5+ minutes without updates. He HATES this. Send message after EVERY file created.
- **Batching updates:** Saying "I created 3 files" after the fact instead of reporting each one as it's done.
- **"???????":** This means I've been silent too long and he's checking if I'm still working. Should never see this if I'm checking in properly.

## Notes

- Telegram user ID stored in TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS env var
- Uses both Telegram and Manor for different workflows
- Building Homestead for personal use, not as a product
- Iterative approach - ship working version, improve later
- Works on DreamFactory commercially (enterprise API platform)
