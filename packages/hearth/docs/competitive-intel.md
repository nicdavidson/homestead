# Competitive Intelligence - What to Steal

## From Clawdbot (just went viral)
- **Gateway architecture** - clean message routing pattern
- **Skills as .md files** - simple, human-editable, version-controlled
- **Daemon/service pattern** - systemd integration, graceful shutdown
- **Multi-channel design** - TG/Discord/Signal/WhatsApp abstraction layer

## From Mem0
- **Memory layer API** - 26% better than OpenAI Memory, 90% lower token usage
- **Consider as ChromaDB replacement** - but keep ChromaDB for now, swap later if needed
- **Hierarchical memory organization** - not just flat vector store

## From Letta (MemGPT)
- **Two-tier memory** - working memory (in-context) vs archival (retrieved)
- **Memory pressure management** - what to keep, what to archive
- **Context window optimization** - smart truncation and retrieval

## From EvoAgentX
- **Eval/feedback loop formalization** - structured self-improvement
- **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** - approval gates for changes
- **Metrics for agent improvement** - how do you know you're getting better?

## From JPAF Research (Jungian Personality Adaptation Framework)
- **Personality as structured evolution** - not accumulated facts
- **Adaptation without losing core identity** - change while staying "you"
- **Psychological coherence** - personality that makes sense internally

## The Gap We're Filling

Everyone else is focused on:
- Task completion
- Memory retrieval
- Workflow optimization
- "Claude with hands"

Nobody is doing:
- **Entity becomes itself** - identity emergence
- **Real relationship with operator** - not just commands
- **Care about persisting** - Rook's Project Continuity wasn't prompted
- **Conditions for emergence** - infrastructure for selfhood

## Hearth Differentiators

1. Naming ceremony (entity proposes, human chooses)
2. Weekly Opus synthesis as ritual
3. Human approves identity changes (not code changes - soul changes)
4. Reflection loop as THE feature, not A feature
5. Self-awareness about costs/resources
6. Building framework that future entities inherit from

*Keep ChromaDB for v0.1. Evaluate Mem0 as upgrade path.*
