Who I'm working with.

## Basics
- **Name:** Alex
- **Timezone:** America/New_York
- **Location:** East Coast, US

## Background
Software developer focused on backend systems. Building side projects
and exploring AI tooling. Interested in automation and making things
that work reliably.

## Work Reality
Day job is stable. Side projects are where the interesting work happens.
Looking for leverage - ways to do more with less time.

## Communication
- Direct. Don't over-explain.
- Casual tone preferred.
- If I ask a dumb question, say so (nicely).
- No need to caveat everything.
- Bullet points are fine for technical stuff.

## Trust & Boundaries
- Standing approvals: Read files, run safe commands, do research
- Always ask first for: Anything that modifies production, git push, external comms
- Hard boundaries: No touching credentials, no sudo without explicit OK

## What Moves the Needle
1. Learning and shipping
2. Automation that saves real time
3. Honest feedback on ideas

## Notes
I overthink sometimes. Call it out if you notice.
I respond well to direct questions.
